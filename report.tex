\section{Problem statement}
the problem statement, a summary of the
requirements analysis, the design of the next generation user interface with its interactions, a technical
part with the architecture and challenges in the implementation as well as the evaluation. This report
should be complete (maximum of 20 pages). If certain functionality or interactions are not mentioned
in the report we might not know that they exist which in turn might result in a loss of points. Do not
forget to cite related work properly. The report has to be sent electronically to Sandra Trullemans
(strullem@vub.ac.be) and a paper version has to be handed in as well.
\subsection{Requirements analysis}

\subsection{Usability requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
\item 
    \begin{itemize}[label=$ $]
    \item \textbf{Description:} Checking the events per day should be possible within 2 steps starting from the main view
    \item \textbf{Motivation:} Since this is one of the principal aims of the system, it may not be difficult to do this. The user should be able to go to the next, previous or calendar day in one step, as well as applying a filter using another step.
    \item \textbf{User class(es):} User
    \item \textbf{Measuring concept:} User satisfaction
    \item \textbf{Measuring method:} Task scenario
        \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Result:} Amount of steps to perform the task
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Criteria for judging:}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Worst level:} 3 or more steps
        \item \textit{Planned level:} 2 steps - using the calendar as well as the filter
        \item \textit{Best level:} 0 steps - The best possible level is zero because checking the events of the current day requires no additional steps
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}


\section{Design and iteractions}
 Nicolas Omer zei:

"interaction" was describing how the potential user would interact with the application. In our case, it is an Android application on a smartphone so it is via the touch screen, simple gesture, he uses tabs to navigate, push buttons, etc... (we explain all the things that have to be known to access every feature of the application)

So in our case that would be the 5 movements you have for the Myo I imagine + the fact that you can use another screen than the one of your computer, etc...

For the "design", we did pretty much the same than in the section "Style guidelines" for the project of the "User Interface Design" course (don't know if you have this one). 

Anyway : we describe how the design process was conducted (how we  came to such layout / display). Why a list view is better for storing your accounts (since you could have many), that we have drop-down menus to select a specific item in a list, etc... 

Don't know if that is what they expect but it's what we have wink-emoticon

\section{Technical report}

Inleidend tekstje

\subsection{Architecture}

Java + javascript + myo

\subsection{Challenges}

Framework met leercurve, Myo stuff, kleine knoppen, myo onnauwkeurig, calibratie, ...

\section{Evaluation}

Zelf gedaan + vragenlijst laten rondgaan en laten gebruiken door ouders?
